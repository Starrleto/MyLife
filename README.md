Making a "My Life" website about yourself or a character in CSS/HTML

Peer Review, Sebastian: A simple but fantastic website. The three-page requirement is met, and on each page there's beautiful imagery. Text is clearly readable. The only comment I have is to use more color variety, though in this website it might be a tad difficult given that the reds and whites used are also paired colors with the character. The character is also a war criminal but thats neither here nor there.
